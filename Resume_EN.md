## Summary
I have been engaged in website development for five years,But in fact,I started writing programs since I was child.The first programing language I learned is Q-basic when I was 10 years old,from that time, I start my programing life.

In my work experience, all around web development include frontend, backend, database, and environment build up.There are something that impressed me is
* I have solved the big problem like "race condition" and saved the company to avoid the emergency situation. 
* I make a team to join Hackathon event, We use just two days to created this amazing project. that project allow strangers to purchases items for people whitch around them.The link can see below.
* I think every language has their own characteristics, so I use phython scrapy framework to crawl the website, and use node.js that can do asynchronous to send the api request at the same time. The point is I never use node.js and python before, so learning new programing language is not hard for me.

My personality is generous, easy-going, responsible, and good communication.In the team, I am usually the person with the most thoughts, not only for programing, can be product, UX/UI, everything.I like to discussion with people who likes programing, and share everything what I know. Design pattern is what I like to study, the code with good pattern will make code clean, smart , reusable. Automation is also my favorite that can make work simple, fast, and easy.like Docker, Continuous Integration, Testing.

If you are looking for someone who has passion for technology, good communication and ideas, I'm your good choice.
